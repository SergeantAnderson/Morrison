His honeymoon period is over. But if you know anything about Scott and his handelling of things, Australia is destined to head down a path of wrong.

Despite the fact that the last two Prime Ministers, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull were cut from the top job, it'd be a miracle if Morrison survived to 2022. Since being elected in 2013 in a huge Blue wave, the Conservative agenda was red hot across Australia, with cuts, and cuts being delivered, with constant budget failures that nearly costed them in 2016. But now, things could be different for the Coalition. A new leader at the helm of this sinking party could turn things around, if they play to their base and not cause any turmoil to have the Austrtalian public loathe them.<p></p>Things could be different now. A fresh leader, a new agenda to make Australia the envy of the globe and the Pacific is a dream that the party aspires to be. Australia now will be stronger under a new plan. A renewed agenda been re-elected. Act on it accordingly. Under the leadership of Scott Morrison, the party will have to position itself to a more Moderate Conservative adgenda, for one not to be knifed...<p>",

Speaking of first term, there is alot on your plate to deal with.

If all goes well, 2004 with be a breaze.

You think back on what you have done wrong and what you could have done better. Unfortunately, Labor will be moving on to a new leader to lead the party in 2004. Simon Crean, the member for Hotham and your Parties Deputy Leader, is eyeing the Labor Party leadership.<p/><p>As of now, you still have your seat of Brand in Western Australia.
